# Automation-Tool-Ansible

**What is Automation?**
Automation is the creation of technology by which a process or procedure is performed with minimal human assistance 
and its application in order to control and monitor the production and delivery of various goods and services.

**Automation Tool: Ansible**
Ansible is an automation tool significantly used for configuration management,infrastructure management. By using this simple
tool from configuration to deployment to zero-downtime rolling upgrades, Ansible is a single framework that can fully automate
today’s modern enterprise apps.

**Why Do We Need Ansible?**

Let us take a little flashback to the beginning of networked computing when deploying and managing servers reliably and 
efficiently has been a challenge. Previously, system administrators managed servers by hand, installing software, changing 
configurations, and administering services on individual servers.

Consider the tedious routine of administering a server fleet. We always need to keep updating, pushing changes, copying 
files on them etc. These tasks make things very complicated and time consuming. The solution to all these problems is – ***Ansible.***

**Key Features**

**Free:** Ansible is an open-source tool.
**Very simple to set up and use:** No special coding skills are necessary to use Ansible’s playbooks (more on playbooks later).
**Powerful:** Ansible lets you model even highly complex IT workflows. 
**Flexible:** You can orchestrate the entire application environment no matter where it’s deployed. You can also customize it based on your needs.
**Agentless:** You don’t need to install any other software or firewall ports on the client systems you want to automate. You also don’t have to set up a separate management structure.
**Efficient:** Because you don’t need to install any extra software, there’s more room for application resources on your server.
